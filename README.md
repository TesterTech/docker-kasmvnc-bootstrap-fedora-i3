## purpose of this repo
- Show the code as used in the YT video. 
- Note: this repo was a fork of (https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-kasmvnc)[Docker Baseimage Kasmvnc] but since it differs so much, I decided to make it seperate. This is not my work (KASM specifically I mean) all rights as per GPL version 3 apply to the KASMVNC Docker baseimage code --> https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-kasmvnc/blob/master/LICENSE
